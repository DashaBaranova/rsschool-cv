- At the moment my goal is to learn a new profession. I want to check my capabilities. Until that moment I had always been in creative professions, I was the head of a children's theater studio, a journalist and a make-up artist. I want to try something that I previously considered difficult and unsuitable for myself. I never wrote a code except for a small html site when I was 14.
- I graduated from the Minsk State College of Arts (faculty of directing theatrical performances and holidays) and Belarusian State University (faculty of Journalism)
- My English level  - B1. I didnâ€™t practice it for a long time
